âœ… Step 1: Idea Validation & MVP Planning
Goal: Confirm what weâ€™re building, why, and for whom.
ðŸ“‹ Deliverables:
-âœ… Clear Product Goal: "Create a tool that converts an entire website (like docs.telegram-mini-apps.com) into a clean, ordered PDF book."
-âœ… Identify core MVP features:
 -Accepts base URL
 -Crawls reachable internal pages
 -Converts each to PDF
 -Merges all PDFs
 -Outputs a single book

âœ… Step 2: SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
Why: Align on exact scope before choosing tools or writing code.
Key sections:
-Functional Requirements (crawl, filter, render, merge, CLI/UI)
-Non-functional: speed, accuracy, ordering, modularity
-Constraints: PDF rendering method, API quota if using services

âœ… Step 3: Tech Stack & Architecture Design
Only after goals are locked, we decide:
-Crawling library (requests, BeautifulSoup, scrapy)
-Rendering: Playwright (free, headless) vs. PDFmyURL (easy, paid)
-PDF merge tool: PyPDF2
-Structure: CLI app or service?
-Environment: venv, requirements.txt, tox, pytest, etc.
ðŸ§± Weâ€™ll also sketch:
-Directory layout (/crawler, /renderer, etc)
-Modular API between steps (e.g., page list â†’ PDF list â†’ merge)

âœ… Step 4: Prepare Development Environment
Only now we:
-Init Git repo (local-first rule)
-Create venv, install:
 -pytest, black, flake8, isort
 -playwright, requests, PyPDF2, etc.
-Prepare .env, .gitignore, Makefile or taskfile.yml (optional)
-Create empty tests/ folder and initial test template

ðŸ§ª Summary: What Should Be Done First?
# Phase 1: Planning & Scoping (NOW)
1. Define MVP goals âœ…
2. Write SRS (core requirements, input/output/flow) ðŸ”„
3. Design architecture and tech stack ðŸ”„

# Phase 2: Environment Setup (AFTER Step 1)
4. Create git repo, venv, install tooling
5. Scaffold project structure
